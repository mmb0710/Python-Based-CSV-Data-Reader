# Python-Based-CSV-Data-Reader

## Overview
**Python-Based-CSV-Data-Reader** is a Python application designed to read, manipulate, and visualize CSV data using the powerful Pandas library. This tool allows users to efficiently filter, sort, and display results in an interactive manner. It's an ideal utility for handling large datasets and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with ease.

## Features
- **Read CSV Files**: Easily import CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter rows based on specific conditions such as column values.
- **Data Sorting**: Sort data by one or more columns in ascending or descending order.
- **Visualization**: Generate basic visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, or scatter plots to explore data trends.
- **Exporting Data**: Export manipulated data to a new CSV file.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interaction through the command-line interface (CLI) or a GUI-based tool.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures the application handles invalid inputs or errors gracefully.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the application.
- **Pandas**: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization (optional features).
- **Tkinter**: (Optional) Used for building a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **CSV**: The format of the data files being read and manipulated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pandas**: Install using pip:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas

  Matplotlib/Seaborn (for optional visualizations):

pip install matplotlib seaborn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/mmb0710/Python-Based-CSV-Data-Reader.git

cd Python-Based-CSV-Data-Reader

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

Once you have your CSV file ready, you can load it into the application. For example:

# Load CSV data
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')

# Example: Filter rows where 'column1' value is greater than 10
filtered_df = df[df['column1'] > 10]

# Example: Sort the DataFrame by 'column2' in descending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='column2', ascending=False)

# Example: Display first 5 rows of the DataFrame
print(filtered_df.head())

# Save the manipulated data to a new CSV file
filtered_df.to_csv('filtered_output.csv', index=False)

Optional Features
Visualization: You can generate plots to visualize data trends:

GUI (Tkinter): If you wish to implement a GUI, the code supports Tkinter for a user-friendly interface. You can extend the project by adding buttons, file pickers, and data display areas.
